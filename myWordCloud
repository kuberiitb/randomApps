  get text from source(twittet/youtube video/copy from text etc)
  get word count
  remove commom words like a, the, no etc..
  define font and color of words(initial idea is frequency based)
  give user the  control of:
    how many max words to use
    how much min freq to use
    remove some keywords
  
  Some of the ideas have been implimented in the current app located at https://kuberiitb.shinyapps.io/myWordCloud/
  Need to fix some bugs in it eg:
    reduce margin in the image file
    bring high freq words in centre for better representation
    color high freq words in lite colors to improve overall beauty
    rename image name, if possible give it a dynamic number say visit id or something like that
    need to make the app lite, when lots of text is entered, its response time is late
    add a help/user manual page
